* Outlay, revenue, deficit, and debt baseline and baseline changes are through the end of 2024. Outlay, deficit, and debt actuals are through 2024. Error statistics are through 2024.
* Actual GDP data are through 2024 and reflect historical information available as of December 2024.
* Corrected minor errors in input data in `baselines.csv`, regarding Customs Duties in the May 2023, February 2024, and June 2024 baselines.

* Expanded code to generate the data for most of the figures in the above report.
